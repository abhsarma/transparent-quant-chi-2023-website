In this session, participants will work in small groups with a provided set of analysis codes to practice and explore nuances of concepts learned in previous sessions. 
This collaborative setup will provide participants with sparring partners to allow deepening of their understanding.
Instructors will monitor the discussion and give support to the groups.
Towards the end of the session, we will discuss lessons and insights and answer recurring questions.

__Hybrid arrangement:__
There will be on-site groups and online groups (not mixed).
The instructors will similarly be on-site and online and support the discussions separately.
If technology permits, the last plenary part will be hybrid.
